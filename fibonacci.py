# Fibonacci Sequence Exercise
# Prompt the user for the number of terms.
# Validate that the input is a positive integer.
# Use a for loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to that many terms.

    while True:
        print("How many sequences would you like?")

        print("Fibonacci sequence:")
        print(a)      # always print first term (0)

        if sequences > 1:
            print(b)  # print the second term (1) if needed

        # Loop to generate the rest of the sequence
        for i in range(2, sequences):  # start at 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed

    # Negative numbers are not possible here because .isdigit() blocks them
